# Linktr.ee_Clone
A clone for Linktree. You can use this to make a list of all of the projects that you've made, share your social medias, etc. Anything you'd do on a real Linktr.ee / Link in Bio Website.

I made a linktr.ee for inspiration. This is it. https://linktr.ee/amhansonn

I am using this as a list of all of my coding projects. I'm working on making a real portfolio, but at the moment you can call this my "portfolio".
